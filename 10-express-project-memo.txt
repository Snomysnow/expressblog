Finish the project:
1. Finish the Compose Page
	1. Flash out the page design (a form that includes a title, post body, and a submit button)
	2. When submitted save the post in the postDB 
	3. Expend the postDB include authors name and time posted
	3. Routes to consider: /compose and /compose/submit
2. Finish the Profile Page
	1. Flash out the page design (bio, username, profile-image, user's posts)
	2. When saved, the information should also be in the userDB
	3. Routes to consider: /profile and /profile/save-changes
3. Finish the Settings Page
	1. Flash out the page design (keep it simple: dark mode - light mode)
	2. When saved, page should only be displayed on that mode, unless the user changes the settings again
	3. Routes to consider: /settings and /settings/save-changes
4. All the pages (Feed, Compose, Profile, Settings) share the same header
	1. Modularize the code by injecting the header.ejs file into each of those webpages

Good luck and have fun!
